 * 	Suppose P is an arithmetic expression in prefix notation. We will evaluate it using a stack to hold the operands.
 * 
 *    Start with an empty stack. We reverse the prefix expressionand  We scan P from left to right.
 *
 *    While (we have not reached the end of P)
 *       If an operand is found
 *          push it onto the stack
 *       End-If
 *       If an operator is found
 *          Pop the stack and call the value A
 *          Pop the stack and call the value B
 *          Evaluate B op A using the operator just found.
 *          Push the resulting value onto the stack
 *       End-If
 *    End-While
 *    Pop the stack (this is the final value)
